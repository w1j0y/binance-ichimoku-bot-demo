# Binance Ichimoku Trading Bot Demo (Signal-Only)

This repository provides a **fully transparent demo** of a Binance trading bot based on the Ichimoku strategy with a strict 3-signal confirmation system.  
No real trades are executed‚Äîthis is for safe testing, learning, and auditing the exact logic that powers the live SaaS bot.

---

## üìä How Does the Ichimoku Bot Decide to Trade?

The bot uses the Ichimoku indicator and will **enter a simulated BUY or SELL** only if **3 or more of the following confirmations** are present on the current hourly candle:

1. **TK Cross**: Tenkan crosses above (bullish) or below (bearish) Kijun.
2. **Kumo Breakout**: Price is above (bullish) or below (bearish) both cloud lines (Span A and Span B).
3. **Kijun Confirmation**: Price is above (bullish) or below (bearish) the Kijun line.
4. **Chikou Breakout**: Chikou span is above (bullish) or below (bearish) the price 26 periods ago.
5. **Kumo Twist**: Span A crosses above (bullish) or below (bearish) Span B.

**Only when 3 or more bullish (or bearish) confirmations occur simultaneously does the bot signal a trade.**  
All logic is fully visible in the template script logs.

## üöÄ How to Use

You have two ways to try the demo bot:

### **Option 1: Telegram Registration (Recommended)**

- Deploy the `telegram_bot_demo.py` bot in the `telegram_bot` folder.
- Complete the full onboarding in Telegram‚Äîthis creates a config `.json` file for you.
- Use that config file in the `coin_ichimoku_template_demo.py` script to see real-time signals, following the full SaaS logic and onboarding flow.

*(See `telegram_bot/README.md` and `bot_templates/README.md` for setup details.)*

---

### **Option 2: Manual Quickstart**

- Go directly to `bot_templates/coin_ichimoku_template_demo.py`.
- Manually fill the required fields at the top of the script:
  - API key and secret (read-only, required for live data)
  - Coin, username, email, and amount‚Äîthese do **not** affect demo trading, but must be present.
- Run the script to view live hourly trading signals and all logic in the terminal/log file.

No Telegram registration or config file required for this mode.
